# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator follows a **microservices architecture** designed for **high availability, scalability, and innovation** across **production**, **development**, and **experimental** environments.

---

## Components Overview
| Environment | Focus |
|--------------|--------|
| **Production** | Stability, security, scalability |
| **Development** | Flexibility, fast iteration, testing |
| **Experimental (AI Build)** | Intelligent automation, predictive scaling, multi-cloud orchestration |

---

## 1. Application Server
| Environment | Details |
|--------------|----------|
| **Production** | Node.js + Express running on **port 8080**, supports **horizontal scaling** with SSL enabled. |
| **Development** | Node.js + Express with **hot reload** on **port 3000**, includes Chrome DevTools debugging. |
| **Experimental** | Node.js + Express + **TensorFlow.js**, running on ports **9000–9002**, supports **AI-powered predictive scaling** and **real-time ML inference** via Kafka event streams. |

---

## 2. Database Layer
| Environment | Details |
|--------------|----------|
| **Production** | PostgreSQL 14 with master-slave replication, daily backups, and SSL. |
| **Development** | Local PostgreSQL (no replication), auto-seeded test data for quick debugging. |
| **Experimental** | **Distributed PostgreSQL cluster (5 nodes)** with **Redis caching** and **ML-based query optimization**, **continuous geo-redundant backups**, and **AI index suggestions**. |

---

## 3. Monitoring System
| Environment | Details |
|--------------|----------|
| **Production** | Prometheus + Grafana dashboards; real-time alerts via email. |
| **Development** | Console-based logging with optional Prometheus; debug stats visible. |
| **Experimental** | Prometheus + Thanos (long-term metrics) + **AI log analysis (ELK + ML models)** with predictive alerts. |

---

## 4. Container Orchestration
| Environment | Details |
|--------------|----------|
| **Development** | Docker Compose for local multi-service setup with hot reload and rapid rebuilds. |
| **Production** | Kubernetes with rolling updates and zero downtime. |
| **Experimental** | Kubernetes + **multi-cloud orchestration** (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean) using global load balancing and automatic cross-cloud failover. |

---

## 5. Authentication System *(Beta)*
- **Method**: OAuth2 + JWT  
- **Providers**: Google, GitHub  
- **Session Storage**: Redis  
- **Availability**: Development & Experimental environments  

---

## 6. AI/ML Pipeline *(Experimental Only)*
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn  
- **Models**:  
  - Anomaly detection (LSTM)  
  - Load prediction (XGBoost)  
  - Auto-scaling optimization (Reinforcement Learning)  
- **Inference**: Real-time (<50ms latency)  
- **Learning**: Continuous online retraining  

---

## Deployment Strategy
| Environment | Details |
|--------------|----------|
| **Production** | Rolling updates, automated rollback, CI/CD with zero downtime. |
| **Development** | Docker Compose-based testing and manual rollback. |
| **Experimental** | AI-driven predictive scaling and **auto-deployment optimization** across multiple clouds. |

---

## Security
| Environment | Security Measures |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Production** | SSL/TLS encryption, encrypted DB connections, secrets management, regular audits. |
| **Development** | SSL disabled for local use, CORS enabled, debug endpoints for testing. |
| **Experimental** | **Zero-trust architecture**, AES-256 encryption, AI anomaly detection for threats, full audit logging. |

---

## Summary ✅
- **Production** → Reliable and secure.  
- **Development** → Fast iteration for testing.  
- **Experimental** → Innovation zone with AI and automation.  

Together, these environments enable **stable operations**, **continuous improvement**, and **intelligent automation** in the DevOps Simulator lifecycle.
